# Hey there 👋

I'm **Vicente Díaz García**, a dedicated **Multiplatform Application Developer in training** who enjoys building software that makes an impact in the real world. I’m always looking to improve my skills, explore new technologies, and create applications that combine creativity with solid code.

I like working both independently and as part of a team, and I’m especially motivated by **mobile development**, **desktop applications**, and **cross-platform projects**. Right now, I’m focusing on **Java**, **Python**, and **multiplatform frameworks**, while constantly learning something new every day.

If you'd like to connect, collaborate, or just chat about code, feel free to reach out! 🚀
